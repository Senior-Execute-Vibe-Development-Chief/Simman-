# M0 questions log

M0 records unresolved specification choices here instead of turning them into
simulation assumptions.

1. `spec/02-architecture.md` describes dev and target grids but does not give
   exact dimensions. M0 uses `240×120` for `dev` and `960×480` for `target`,
   matching the documented simulation-width conventions in the research notes.
   Please confirm the dimensions and whether width/height refer to simulation
   cells or render pixels before the first terrain field lands.
2. The M0 math contract gives an approximate accuracy and cross-engine
   requirement, but no required approximation family or complete input domain.
   M0 uses explicit range reduction and Taylor/atanh series. The coefficients
   are implementation scaffolding, not physical constants, and should be
   replaced or ratified if a later gate requires a different domain.
3. The WASM bootstrap specifies one deterministic Dijkstra function and a
   hardcoded test graph but does not specify the graph topology or expected
   distances. M0 uses a five-node graph with distances `[0, 2, 3, 4, 6]`;
   this is a toolchain fixture only and must not become routing physics.
