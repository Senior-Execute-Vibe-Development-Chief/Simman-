//   2. Transport distance to the nearest existing settlement
//      (computed by transport.js — terrain-weighted Dijkstra).
//
// Sites close in transport (knowledge diffuses from neighbours via
// trade and migration along easy corridors) crystallize fast. Sites
// very far away can still crystallize through INDEPENDENT INVENTION
// at a low baseline rate — matches the historical pattern of separate
// agricultural revolutions in the Levant, Yangtze, Indus, Mesoamerica.
//
// Knowledge inherited from the nearest settlement gets diluted with
// transport distance: a settlement spawning right next to a city
// inherits most of its tech; one that crystallises in isolation starts
// near the cradle baseline.
